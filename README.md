## How to use

To use the LaTex math simply first write the equation in latex notation. I recomend [this site](https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php) for those of you who don't know latex that well.

Once you have your LaTex simply suround it with one of these three options:
- $$LaTeX$$ for inline math
- \\(LaTeX\\) for inline math
- \\[LaTeX\\] for display math

To use code the format is the same as Github's markdown:

'''NAMEOFLANGUAGE

code goes here...
